Hello

This project consisted in the generation of an evolutionary computation-based system capable of generate and evolve the structures of which one level of the Angry Birds game is composed, these structures are evaluated according to these particular rules:
•	The stability of the structure
•	The complexity of said structure

The current main values of the genetic algorithm are:

| Element  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Population  | 10  |
| Max number of generations  | 5  |
| Pieces by individual *  | 10  |
| Selection type  |  Single-point, double-point and Uniform crossover  |
| Mutation percentage  | 40%  |
| Mutation type  | Random mutation, add value mutation, remove value mutation  |
| Selection type  | Ordered - top to bottom  |
