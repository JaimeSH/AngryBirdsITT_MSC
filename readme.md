Hello

This project consisted in the generation of an evolutionary computation-based system capable of generate and evolve the structures of which one level of the Angry Birds game is composed, these structures are evaluated according to these particular rules:
•	The stability of the structure
•	The complexity of said structure

The current main values of the genetic algorithm are:
|    Element    |     Value     |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|   Population    |      10       |
|  Max. Gen Num   |      5        |
|   Ind. Pieces   |      10       |
| Selection type  |      5        |
| Mex. Gen Num  |      5        |
|  Population   |      10       |
